## 9. Find the missing IP address

Suppose you were given a file containing roughly one billion IP addresses, each of which is a 32-bit quantity. How would you programmatically find an IP address that is not in the file? Assume you have unlimited drive space but only a few megabytes of RAM at your disposal.

> Hint: Can you be sure there is an address which is not in the file?
