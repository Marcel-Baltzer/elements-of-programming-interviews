## 1. Search a sorted array for first occurrence of k

Write a method that takes a sorted array and a key and returns the index of the first occurrence of that key in the array. For example, when applied to the array [-14,-10,2,108,108,243,285,285,285,401] your algorithm should return 3 if the given key is 108; if it is 285, your algorithm should return 6.

> Hint: What happens when every entry equals k? Don't stop when you first see k.
