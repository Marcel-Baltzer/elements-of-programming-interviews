## 7. Find the min and max simultaneously

Design an algorithm to find the min and max elements in an array. For example, if A = [3,2,5,1,2,4], you should return 1 for the min and 5 for the max.

> Hint: Use the fact that a < b and b < c implies a < c to reduce the number of compares used by the brute-force approach.
