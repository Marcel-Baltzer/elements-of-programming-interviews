## 3. Search a cyclically sorted array

Design an O(log n) algorithm for finding the position of the smallest element in a cyclically sorted array. Assume all elements are distinct. For example, for the array [378,478,550,631,103,203,220,234,279,368], your algorithm should return 4.

> Hint: Use the divide and conquer principle.
