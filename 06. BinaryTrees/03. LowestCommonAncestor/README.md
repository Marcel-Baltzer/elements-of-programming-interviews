## 3. Compute the lowest common ancestor in a binary tree

Any two nodes in a binary tree have a common ancestor, namely the root. The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of any two nodes in a binary tree is the node furthest from the root that is an ancestor of both nodes.

Design an algorithm for computing the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree in which nodes do not have a parent field.

> Hint: When is the root the LCA?
