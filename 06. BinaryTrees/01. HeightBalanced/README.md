## 1. Test if a binary tree is height-balanced

A binary tree is said to be height-balanced if for each node in the tree, the difference in the height of its left and right subtrees is at most one.

Write a program that takes as input the root of a binary tree and checks whether the tree is height-balanced.

> Hint: Think of a classic binary tree algorithm.
