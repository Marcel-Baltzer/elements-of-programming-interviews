## 13. Reconstruct a binary tree from a preorder traversal with markers

Design an algorithm for reconstructing a binary tree from a preorder traversal visit sequence that uses null to mark empty children.

> Hint: It's difficult to solve this problem by examining the preorder traversal visit sequence from left-to-right.
