## 11. Test if three binary search tree nodes are totally ordered

Write a program which takes two nodes in a BST and a third node, the "middle" node, and determines if one of the two nodes is a proper ancestor and the other a proper descendant of the middle. (A proper ancestor of a node is an ancestor that is not equal to the node; a proper descendant is defined similarly.) You can assume that all keys are unique. Nodes do not have pointers to their parents

> Hint: For what specific arrangements of the three nodes does the check pass?
