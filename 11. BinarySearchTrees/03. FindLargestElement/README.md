## 3. Find the k largest elements in a binary search tree

A binary search tree is a sorted data structure, which suggests that it should be possible to find the k largest keys easily.

Write a program that takes as input a binary search tree and an integer k, and returns the k largest elements in the binary search tree in decreasing order.
