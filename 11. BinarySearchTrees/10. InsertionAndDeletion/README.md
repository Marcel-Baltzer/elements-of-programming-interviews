## 10. Insertion and deletion in a binary search tree

A binary search tree is a dynamic data structure - in particular, if implemented carefully key insertion and deletion can be made very fast.

Design efficient functions for inserting and removing keys in a binary search tree. Assume that all elements in the binary search tree are unique, and that your insertion method must preserve this property.

> Hint: Deleting leaves is easy. Pay attention to the children of internal nodes when you delete it.
