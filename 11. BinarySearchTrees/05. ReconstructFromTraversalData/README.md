## 5. Reconstruct a binary search tree from traversal data

Suppose you are given the sequence in which keys are visited in an inorder traversal of a binary search tree, and all keys are distinct. Can you reconstruct the binary search tree from the sequence? If so, write a program to do so. Solve the same problem for preorder and postorder traversal sequences.

> Hint: Draw the five binary search trees on the keys 1,2,3, and the corresponding traversal orders.
