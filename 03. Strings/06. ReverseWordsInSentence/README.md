## 6. Reverse all the wordsin a sentence

Given a string containing a set of words separated by whitespace, we would like to transform it to a string in which the words appear in the reverse order. For example, "Alice likes Bob" transforms to "Bob likes Alice". We do not need to keep the original string.

Implement a function for reversing the words in a string s.

>Hint: It's difficult to solve this with one pass.
