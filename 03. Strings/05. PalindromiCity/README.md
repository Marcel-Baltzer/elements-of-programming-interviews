## 5. Test palindromicity

For the purpose of this problem, define a palindromic string to be a string which when all the nonalphanumeric are removed it reads the same front to back ignoring case. For example, "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama." and "Able was I, ere I saw Elba!" are palindromic, but "Ray a Ray" is not.

Implement a function which takes as input a string s and returns true if s is a palindromic string.

>Hint: Use two indices.
