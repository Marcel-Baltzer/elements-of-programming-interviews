## 1. Interconvert strings and integers

A string is a sequence of characters. A string may encode an integer, e.g., "123" encodes 123. In this problem, you are to implement methods that take a string representing an integer and return the corresponding integer, and vice versa. Your code should handle negative integers. You cannot use library functions like stoi in C++ and parseInt in Java.

Implement string/integer inter-conversion functions.

>Hint: Build the result one digit at a time.
