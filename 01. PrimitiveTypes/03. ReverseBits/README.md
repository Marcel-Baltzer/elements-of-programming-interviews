## 3. Reverse bits

Write a program that takes a 64-bit word and returns the 64-bit word consisting of
the bits of the input word in reverse order. For example, if the input is alternating 1s
and 0s, i.e., (1010...10), the output should be alternating 0s and 1s, i.e., (0101...01).

>Hint: Use a lookup table.
