## 9. Check if a decimal integer is a palindrome

A palindromic string is one which reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g., "redivider". In this problem, you are to write a program which determines if the decimal representation of an integer is a palindromic string. For example, your program should return true for the inputs 0,1,7,11,121,333, and 2147447412, and false for the inputs-1,12,100, and 2147483647.

Write a program that takes an integer and determinesif that integer'srepresentation as a decimalstring is a palindrome.

>Hint: It's easy to come up with a simple expression that extracts the least significant digit. Can you find a simple expression for the most significant digit?
