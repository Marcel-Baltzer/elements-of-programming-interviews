## 10. Generate uniform random numbers

This problem is motivated by the following scenario. Six friends have to select a designated driver using a single unbiased coin. The process should be fair to everyone.

How would you implement a random number generator that generates a random integer i between a and b, inclusive, given a random number generator that produces zero or one with equal probability? All values in [a, b] should be equally likely.

>Hint: How would you mimic a three-sided coin with a two-sided coin?
