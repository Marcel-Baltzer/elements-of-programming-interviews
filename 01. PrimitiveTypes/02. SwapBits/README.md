## 2. Swap bits

A 64-bit integer can be viewed as an array of 64 bits, with the bit at index 0 corresponding to the least significant bit (LSB), and the bit at index 63 corresponding to the most significant bit (MSB). Implement code that takes as input a 64-bit integer and swaps the bits at indices i and j.

>Hint: When is the swap necessary?
