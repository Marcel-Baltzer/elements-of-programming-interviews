## 11. Rectangle intersection

This problem is concerned with rectangles whose sides are parallel to the X-axis and Y-axis.

Write a program which tests if two rectangles have a nonempty intersection. If the intersection is nonempty, return the rectangle formed by their intersection.

>Hint: Think of the X and Y dimensions independently.
