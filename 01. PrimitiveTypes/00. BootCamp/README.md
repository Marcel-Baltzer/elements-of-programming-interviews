Writing a program to count the number of bits that are set to 1 in an integer is a good way to get up to speed with primitive types. The following program tests bits one-at-a-time starting with the least-significant bit. It illustrates shifting and masking; it also shows how to avoid hard-coding the size of the integer word.
