## 7. Compute binary tree nodes in order of increasing depth

Binary trees are formally defined in next Chapter. In particular, each node in a binary tree has a depth, which is its distance from the root.

Given a binary tree, return an array consisting of the keys at the same level. Keys should appear in the order of the corresponding nodes' depths, breaking ties from left to right.

> Hint: First think about solving this problem with a pair of queues.
