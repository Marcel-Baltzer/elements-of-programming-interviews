## 4. Normalize pathname

Write a program which takes a pathname, and returns the shortest equivalent pathname. Assume individual directories and files have names that use only alphanumeric characters. Subdirectory names may be combined using forward slashes (/), the current directory (.), and parent directory (..).

> Hint: Trace the cases. How should . and .. be handled? Watch for invalid paths.
