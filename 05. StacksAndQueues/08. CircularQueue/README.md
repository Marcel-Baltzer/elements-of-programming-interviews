## 8. Implement a circular queue

Implement a queue API using an array for storing elements. Your API should include a constructor function, which takes as argument the initial capacity of the queue, enqueue and dequeue functions, and a function which returns the number of elements stored. Implement dynamic resizing to support storing an arbitrarily large number of elements.

> Hint: Track the head and tail. How can you differentiate a full queue from an empty one?
