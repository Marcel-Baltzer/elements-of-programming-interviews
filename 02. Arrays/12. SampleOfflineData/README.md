## 12. Sample offline data

This problem is motivated by the need for a company to select a random subset of its customers to roll out a new feature to. For example, a social networking company may want to see the effect of a new UI on page visit duration without taking the chance of alienating all its usersif the rollout is unsuccessful.

Implement an algorithm that takes asinput an array of distinct elements and a size, and returns a subset of the given size of the array elements. All subsets should be equally likely. Return the result in input array itself.

>Hint: How would you construct a random subset of size k + 1 given a random subset of size k?
