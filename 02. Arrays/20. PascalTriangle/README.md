## 20. Compute rows in Pascal's Triangle

![Pascal Triangle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif)

The gif shows the first five rows of a graphic that is known as Pascal's triangle. Each row contains one more entry than the previous one. Except for entries in the last row, each entry is adjacent to one or two numbers in the row below it. The first row holds 1. Each entry holds the sum of the numbers in the adjacent entries above it.

Write a program which takes as input a nonnegative integer n and returns the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.

>Hint: Write the given fact as an equation.
