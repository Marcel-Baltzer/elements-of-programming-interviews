## 16. Generate nonuniform random numbers

Suppose you need to write a load test for a server. You have studied the inter-arrival time of requests to the server over a period of one year. From this data you have computed a histogram of the distribution of the inter-arrival time of requests. In the load test you would like to generate requests for the server such that the inter-arrival times come from the same distribution that was observed in the historical data. The following problem formalizes the generation of inter-arrival times.

You are given n numbers as well as probabilities p<sub>0</sub>, p<sub>1</sub>, ..., p<sub>n-1</sub> which sum up to 1. Given a random number generator that produces values in [0,1] uniformly, how would you generate one of the n numbers according to the specified probabilities? For example, if the numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, and the probabilities are 9/18, 6/18, 2/18, 1/18, then in 1000000 calls to your program, 3 should appear roughly 500000 times, 5 should appear roughly 333333 times, 7 should appear roughly 111111 times, and 11 should appear roughly 55555 times.

>Hint: Look at the graph of the probability that the selected number is less than or equal to a. What do the jumps correspond to?
