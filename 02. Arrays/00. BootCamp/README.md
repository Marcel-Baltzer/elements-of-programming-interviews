The following problem gives good insight into working with arrays: Your input is an array of integers, and you have to reorder its entries so that the even entries appear first. This is easy if you use O(n) space, where n is the length of the array. However, you are required to solve it without allocating additional storage.

>Hint: When working with arrays you should take advantage of the fact that you can operate efficiently on both ends.
