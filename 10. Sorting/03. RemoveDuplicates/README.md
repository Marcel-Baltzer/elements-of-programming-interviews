## 3. Remove First-Name Duplicates

Design an efficient algorithm for removing all first-name duplicates from an array. For example, if the input is ((Ian, Botham), (David, Gower), (Ian, Bell), (Ian, Chappell)), one result could be ((Ian, Bell), (David, Gower)); ((David, Gower), (Ian, Botham)) would also be acceptable.

> Hint: Bring equal items close together.
