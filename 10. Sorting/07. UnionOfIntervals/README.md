## 7. Compute the union of intervals

In this problem we consider sets of intervals with integer endpoints; the intervals may be open or closed at either end. We want to compute the union of the intervals in such sets.

Design an algorithm that takes as input a set of intervals, and outputs their union expressed as a set of disjoint intervals.

> Hint: Do a case analysis.
