## 4. Smallest non constructible value

Given a set of coins, there are some amounts of change that you may not be able to make with them, e.g., you cannot create a change amount greater than the sum of the your coins. For example, if your coins are 1,1,1,1,1,5,10,25, then the smallest value of change which cannot be made is 21.

Write a program which takes an array of positive integers and returns the smallest number which is not to the sum of a subset of elements of the array.

> Hint: Manually solve for a few short arrays.
