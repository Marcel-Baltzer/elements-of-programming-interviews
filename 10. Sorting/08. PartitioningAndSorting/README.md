## 8. Partitioning and sorting an array with many repeated entries

You are given an array of student objects. Each student has an integer-valued age field that is to be treated as a key. Rearrange the elements of the array so that students of equal age appear together. The order in which different ages appear is not important. How would your solution change if ages have to appear in sorted order?

> Hint: Count the number of students for each age.
