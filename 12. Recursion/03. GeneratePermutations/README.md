## 3. Generate permutations

This problem is concerned with computing all permutations of an array. For example, if the array is (2,3,5,7) one output could be (2,3,5,7), (2,3,7,5), (2,5,3,7), (2,5,7,3), (2,7,3,5), (2,7,5,3), (3,2,5,7), (3,2,7,5), (3,5,2,7), (3,5,7,2), (3,7,2,5), (3,7,5,2), (5,2,3,7), (5,2,7,3), (5,3,2,7), (5,3,7,2), (5,7,2,3), (5,7,2,3), (7,2,3,5), (7,2,5,3), (7,3,2,5), (7,3,5,2), (7,5,2,3), (7,5,3,2). (Any other ordering is acceptable too.)

Write a program which takes as input an array of distinct integers and generates all permutations of that array. No permutation of the array may appear more than once.
