## 10. Compute a Gray code

An n-bit Gray code is a permutation of {0,1, 2,...,2^n - 1) such that the binary representations of successive integers in the sequence differ in only one place. (This is with wraparound, i.e., the last and first elements must also differ in only one place.)

Write a program which takes n as input and returns an n-bit Gray code.

> Hint: Write out Gray codes for n = 2,3, 4.
