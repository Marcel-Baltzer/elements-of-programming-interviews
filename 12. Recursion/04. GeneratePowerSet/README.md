## 4. Generate the power set

The power set of a set S is the set of all subsets of S, including both the empty set 0 and S itself.
The power set of (0,1,2) is (0,(0),(1),(2),(0,1),(1,2),(0,2),(0,1,2)).


Write a function that takes as input a set and returns its power set.

> Hint: There are 2^n subsets for a given set S of size n. There are 2^k k-bit words.
