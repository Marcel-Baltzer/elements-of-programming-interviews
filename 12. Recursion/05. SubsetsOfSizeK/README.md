## 5. Generate all subsets of size k

There are a number of testing applications in which it is required to compute all subsets of a given size for a specified set.

Write a program which computes all size k subsets of {1, 2,..., n}, where k and n are program inputs. For example, if k = 2 and n = 5, then the result is the following: ((1,2), (1,3), (1 4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5))

> Hint: Think of the right function signature.
