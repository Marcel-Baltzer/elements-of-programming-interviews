## 9. Implement a Sudoku solver

Sudoku is a popular logic-based combinatorial number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9X9 grid with digits subject to the constraint that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains unique integers in [1,9].

Implement a Sudoku solver.

> Hint: Apply the constraints to speed up a brute-force algorithm.
