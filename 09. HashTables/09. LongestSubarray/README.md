## 9. Find the longest subarray with distinct entries

Write a program that takes an array and returns the length of a longest subarray with the property that all its elements are distinct. For example, if the array is (f,s,f,e,t,w,e,n,w,e) then a longest subarray all of whose elements are distinct is (s,f,e,t,w).

> Hint: What should you do if the subarray from indices i to j satisfies the property, but the subarray from i to j+1 does not?
