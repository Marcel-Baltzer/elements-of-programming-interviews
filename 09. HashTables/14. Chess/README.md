## 14. Implement a hash function for chess

Design a hash function for chess game states. Your function should take a state and the hash code for that state, and a move, and efficiently compute the hash code for the updated state.

> Hint: XOR is associative, commutative, and fast to compute. Additionally, a xor a = 0.
