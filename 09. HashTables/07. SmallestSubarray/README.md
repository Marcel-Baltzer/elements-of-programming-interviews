## 7. Find the smallest subarray covering all values

Write a program which takes an array of strings and a set of strings, and return the indices of the starting and ending index of a shortest subarray of the given array that "covers" the set, i.e., contains all strings in the set.

> Hint: What is the maximum number of minimal subarrays that can cover the query?
