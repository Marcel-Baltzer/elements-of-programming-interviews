# LinkedLists

0. BootCamp
1. Merge two sorted lists
2. Reverse a single sublist
3. Test for cyclicity
4. Test for overlapping lists-lists are cycle-free
5. Test for overlapping lists-lists may have cycles
6. Delete a node from a singly linked list
7. Remove the kth last element from a list
8. Remove duplicates from a sorted list
9. Implement cyclic right shift for singly linked lists
10. Implement even-odd merge
11. Test whether a singly linked list is palindromic
12. Implement list pivoting
13. Add list-based integers

For all problems in this chapter, unless otherwise stated, each node has two entries - a data field, and a next field, which points to the next node in the list, with the next field of the last node being null.

Its prototype is as follows:

```C#
class ListNode<T>
{
    public T Data;
    public ListNode<T> Next;
}
```
