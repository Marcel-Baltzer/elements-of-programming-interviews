## 2. Reverse a single sublist

Write a program which takes a singly linked list L and two integers s and f as arguments, and reverses the order of the nodes from the sth node to fth node, inclusive. The numbering begins at 1, i.e., the head node is the first node. Do not allocate additional nodes.

> Hint: Focus on the successor fields which have to be updated.
