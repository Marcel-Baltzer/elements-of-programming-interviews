## 7. Remove the kth last element from a list

Given a singly linked list and an integer k, write a program to remove the kth last element from the list. Your algorithm cannot use more than a few words of storage, regardless of the length of the list. In particular, you cannot assume that it is possible to record the length of the list.

> Hint: If you know the length of the list, can you find the kth last node using two iterators?
